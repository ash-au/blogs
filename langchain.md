# Langchain


A framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that
 - Are context aware: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples etc)
 - Reason: rely on language model to reason

Framework consists for several parts
## Part of Framework
### LangChain Libraries
Python and Javascript libraries. Contains interfaces and integrations for myriad of components, a  basic runtime for combining these components into chains and agents, and off-the-shelf implementations of chains and agents
### Lanchain Templates
A collection of easily deployable reference architectures for a wide variety of tasks
### LangServe
A library for deploying LangChain chains as a REST API
### LangSmith
A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain

## Other Components
### LlamaIndex
A tool that acts as a bridge between your custom data and LLMs like GPT-4. Whether you have data stored in APIs, databases, or PDFs LlamaIndex makes it easy to bring that data into conversation with these smart machines. This bridge-building makes your data more accessible and usable, paving the way for creating powerful custom LLM applications and workflows
